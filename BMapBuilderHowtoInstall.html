<h1>Users' documentation for BMapBuilder 1.0</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Java Runtime Environment</h3>
BMapBuilder is a Java program. In order to use it, you need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.4 or later. If you do not have it, get and install the newest version of the JRE at:

<a href="http://www.java.com/">Sun JRE</a>

<h3>Download BMapBuilder</h3>

Download <a href="/BMapBuilder/BMapBuilder.jar">BMapBuilder.jar</a>


<h3>Install BMapBuilder</h3>

<h4>Windows, Mac OSX</h4>
You should be able to start the program by double-clicking on the jar file.
The program can also be run by typing java -jar BMapBuilder.jar  on the command line. 
<!--For large datasets the use of this second option is mandatory for the program to work. Moreover, the argument -Xmx<b>M</b>m, with <b>M</b> being the maximum internal memory your computer can use in Megabytes, must be added. As an example, 
<br>java -jar -Xmx1000m BMapBuilder.jar will allow the program to use a maximum of 1000 MB memory.
<br><b>Note:</b>The program will not work when launched by double-click on the jar file if the input file is too large.-->

<h4>Unix, Linux</h4>
The program can be run by typing java -jar BMapBuilder.jar  on the command line.
<!-- We recommend to use the argument -Xmx if the program return an "out of memory" error.-->

<h3>Input file format</h3>
<p>Text files with at least three columns, no matters the order, are required. 
Each row contains information for a pair of SNPs.

<br>
The three columns correspond to the SNP positions of each SNP in the pair and the estimation value (which must be a value in the interval [0,1]).
<br>
Besides these three columns, the program can also uses the major allele relative frequency for each SNP in the pair, i.e., two more columns.
Once again, the order is not important as the program allows the user to choose the colums.
<br>
Other columns in the file will not be taken into account.
<br><a href="test.pm">Here</a> there is a very small file than can be used as an example of input file.</br>
</p>

<h3>Output file format</h3>
<p>The bitmap will be written in a png graphic file. 
<br>For each snp pair, a square with <b>res</b> bits side will be used to represent the value of the estimation, following this scale:

<br><img align="center" src="/BMap/scale.png">
<br>The value of <b>res</b> can be chosen in the program as well as the color tones (green, red or blue). 
<br>We do not recommend resolutions greater than 5 for large files, as those at the <a href"http://www.hapmap.org">International Hapmap Project website</a>. 

<h3>How to use BMapBuilder</h3>
In order to build a new bitmap you have to use option "Build" in the "File" menu.
<br>The following parameters will be required to the user:
<ul>
<li>Column where position for the first SNP is</li>
<li>Column where position for the second SNP is </li>
<li>Column where the estimator (D', r, LOD or whatever) is</li>
<li>Color to be used (red, green or blue)</li>
<li>Resolution to be used (for larga data sets, high resolutions should only be used if the computer has enough RAM memory)</li>
</ul>
